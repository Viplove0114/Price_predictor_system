# Price Predictor System

## 📌 Project Description
The **Price Predictor System** is a machine learning project designed to predict prices based on provided data. The system consists of data preprocessing, model training, and prediction functionalities. It uses libraries such as `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, and `joblib` for efficient data handling and model persistence.

## 🚀 What Makes This Project Different
- **Enhanced Modularity:** Unlike many similar projects, this system separates data preprocessing, model training, and prediction into distinct scripts, improving code maintainability and flexibility.
- **Efficient Model Persistence:** Using `joblib` ensures faster loading times and efficient model management, making it suitable for larger datasets.
- **Custom Utility Functions:** The inclusion of reusable utility functions optimizes repetitive tasks, improving the system's performance and reusability.
- **Scalable Architecture:** The project is designed with scalability in mind, allowing easy integration of additional machine learning models or preprocessing steps.
- **Well-Structured Workflow:** The organized folder structure and clear code documentation make the project easy to navigate and extend.

## 🚀 Advantages of the Coding Approach
- **Modularity:** The project follows a modular coding approach by separating model training, prediction, and utility functions into different scripts, making the system easy to maintain and extend.
- **Reusability:** The use of utility functions and reusable components reduces code duplication and enhances maintainability.
- **Efficiency:** Using `joblib` for model persistence ensures faster loading times and efficient model handling.
- **Scalability:** The modular structure allows for easy integration of additional machine learning models or preprocessing steps.
- **Clarity & Readability:** Well-structured file organization and clear code comments improve code readability and collaboration potential.

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository
If you're working from a Git repository, clone the project:
```bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd prices-predictor-system
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
Install the required Python packages by running:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Environment Setup
Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed and the necessary dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.

## 🚀 Usage Instructions

### Running the System
1. **Train the Model:**
    ```bash
    python model.py
    ```
    - This trains the model and saves it using `joblib`.

2. **Make Predictions:**
    - To predict prices using new data, run:
    ```bash
    python predict.py
    ```

### Input Data Format
Ensure your input data files are in CSV format with appropriate columns required by the model.

## 🧑‍🏫 Model Training & Prediction
- `model.py`: Contains the script to preprocess data and train the model.
- `predict.py`: Loads the trained model and makes predictions.
